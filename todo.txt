TODO:
- The http error retries handling is displaying the wrong retry number. Starts at  0 or 1 I think and ends at 2 while the tries count is actually 3. Maybe rename it back to retries in the messages and keep tries in code

DONE!!!
1. fix rate limits - rip
2. add more status messages - create a class and a class method for the map function!!! handle status messages there using class properties
3. The scan button works while hint text is active (maybe try adding a class property for the scrolledtextwithhnt to help communication)

### Main
Roblox ERP Scraper is a tool designed to help Roblox moderator efficiently stop and ban ERP Groups.
It works like this:
1. Input one or more 'root' groups.
2. Gets a list of all players within these groups
3. Gets a list of all groups each of these players is in
4. Ranks each 'child' group based on the ammount of players from the 'root' group who occured within them
5. Saves the result to a file
Most rule-breaking players create so-called alt-accounts. These are used mostly for the breaking the rules, while their 'main' account is untouched.
Because of this a number of the detected 'child' groups will be actual ERP groups. Though the accuracy may vary.
